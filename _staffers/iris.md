Hi everyone! My name is Iris and I’m a B.S/M.S. student in computer science. I’m very excited to be tutoring for CS 16 this quarter. When I first took CS 8, I was a math major trying to fulfill a pre-major requirement and had no prior programming experience. Initially, I found myself lost and confused in this strange world of programming, but the incredible support I received from my TAs, tutors, and the professor really helped me out and inspired me to continue taking CS courses. I eventually changed my major and developed a passion for helping others learn how to code. As a former ULA (CS 8, CS 16, CS 24, CS 130A) and current TA, I love contributing to creating a supportive and encouraging environment for my peers! I believe that anyone can achieve their dreams given the right support. I hope to answer any questions you all might have, but also show you all that you are capable of coding regardless of prior experience!

In my spare time I enjoy admiring art, listening to music, weightlifting, and snowboarding. Don’t be afraid to come to me with any questions, concerns, or general thoughts. I’m here to help! :-)
