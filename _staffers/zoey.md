Hi, everyone! I am a first-year master's student in the CS department. My one-year work experience as a software development engineer has given me hands-on experience in developing and maintaining mobile applications. 

I'm here to help you with any questions or concerns you may have regarding your coursework or the industries related to computer science. If you need assistance or guidance, don't hesitate to contact me through Piazza or email. I'm looking forward to starting this incredible journey in coding with you all and supporting you along the way.
